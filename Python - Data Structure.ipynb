It looks through the keys of the dictionary.\n","\n","Example:\n","my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n","print(\"name\" in my_dict)  # Output: True\n","print(\"Alice\" in my_dict)  # Output: False (Looks for keys, not values)\n","\n","15.** Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?**\n","\n","No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple in Python.\n","\n","Reason:\n","Tuples are immutable data structures. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. This immutability ensures that the data stored in a tuple remains constant, which helps in maintaining data integrity and making the code more predictable.\n","\n","my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n","my_tuple[0] = 10  # Error: Tuples are immutable\n","\n","16.What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n","\n","A nested dictionary is a dictionary where the values are other dictionaries. It allows you to represent more complex data structures by nesting dictionaries within each other.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","employees = {\n","    \"emp1\": {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"position\": \"Manager\"},\n","    \"emp2\": {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25, \"position\": \"Developer\"},\n","    \"emp3\": {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 28, \"position\": \"Designer\"}\n","}\n","\n","Accessing nested data\n","print(employees[\"emp1\"][\"name\"])  # Output: Alice\n","\n","17.**Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary**\n","\n","The time complexity of accessing elements in a Python dictionary is O(1) on average. This means that accessing a value using a key is a constant-time operation, regardless of the size of the dictionary.\n","\n","why O(1) Time Complexity?\n","Dictionaries in Python are implemented using hash tables:\n","\n","When you access a value using a key (dict[key]), Python hashes the key to compute a unique index and retrieves the value directly from that index.\n","This direct access avoids the need to search through the entire dictionary, resulting in constant time complexity for lookups.\n","\n","18.In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","\n","When Order Matters:\n","Lists maintain the order of elements, which is important when the sequence of data matters. Dictionaries only guarantee insertion order starting from Python 3.7, but lists are still more natural for ordered collections.\n","\n","When You Need to Store Multiple Occurrences of the Same Item:\n","Lists allow duplicates, whereas dictionaries store data in key-value pairs where keys must be unique. If you need to store multiple instances of the same value, lists are a better fit.\n","\n","my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]  # Allows duplicates\n","\n","When You Need Index-Based Access:\n","Lists allow you to access elements using their index (position) in the sequence, making them ideal for cases where you need to access elements by position.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n","print(my_list[1])  # Output: 20 (Access by index)\n","\n","When You're Using a Fixed Size or Sequence of Elements:\n","Lists are better when you need to perform operations on a collection that has a fixed or predictable size, or when the collection represents a sequence of values.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","my_list = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n","\n","19.**Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?**\n","\n","Before Python 3.7, dictionaries were considered unordered because they did not guarantee the order of elements. This was due to their implementation using hash tables, which do not preserve the insertion order of items. The keys in the dictionary are hashed to determine their location, and this process doesn't maintain any specific order.\n","\n","However, starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain insertion order, meaning that items are stored in the order they were added. But, technically, they are still considered unordered collections because the underlying structure (hash table) doesn't inherently require order. The order is just an implementation detail in modern versions.\n","\n","How This Affects Data Retrieval?\n","\n","Before Python 3.7:\n","\n","Data retrieval by key is still efficient (O(1) time complexity), but you cannot rely on the order of elements when iterating over the dictionary.\n","The dictionary might return keys in an arbitrary order.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}\n","\n","for key in my_dict:\n","\n","    print(key)    # The order is unpredictable in versions before 3.7\n","\n","20.**Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.**\n","\n","difference Between List and Dictionary in Terms of Data Retrieval\n","\n","Data Structure:\n","List: A list is an ordered collection that stores elements by index. Each item in the list has a unique position (index), and data is retrieved using this index.\n","Dictionary: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. Data is retrieved using keys (not indices).\n","\n","Data Retrieval:\n","List: Data is accessed by indexing, meaning you specify the position of the item in the list. Retrieval is done using the index value (e.g., my_list[2]).\n","\n","Time Complexity: O(1) for direct access by index.\n","Example:\n","\n","my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n","print(my_list[1])  # Output: 20\n","\n","Dictionary: Data is accessed by key.
