        "#1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "\n",
        "A RESTful API is an Application Programming Interface that follows the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer). It uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. REST is stateless, meaning each request from a client must contain all necessary information. Data is usually exchanged in JSON or XML formats. RESTful APIs allow communication between different systems or applications over the web. They are scalable, lightweight, and widely used in web development. REST emphasizes resources, which are represented by URLs (endpoints). For example, /users may represent a resource of users. REST APIs also rely on HTTP status codes for error handling and success responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2. Explain the concept of API specification\n",
        "\n",
        "An API specification is a formal contract that defines how a client can interact with an API. It describes the endpoints, request/response formats, parameters, authentication methods, and error codes. API specifications help developers understand how to use the API without needing to see its code. Popular specification formats include OpenAPI (Swagger) and RAML. They ensure consistency across teams and projects. With an API specification, you can also automatically generate documentation and even mock servers for testing. This makes collaboration between backend and frontend teams easier. Specifications reduce misunderstandings and serve as a blueprint for development.\n",
        "\n",
        "#3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask is a lightweight Python web framework used to build web applications and APIs. It is based on Werkzeug (for WSGI) and Jinja2 (for templating). Flask is popular because it is simple, flexible, and minimalistic, allowing developers to start small and scale when needed. Unlike larger frameworks like Django, Flask does not enforce strict project structures. Developers can pick only the extensions they need, such as Flask-SQLAlchemy or Flask-RESTful. Flask has a large community, plenty of documentation, and is beginner-friendly. Its simplicity makes it an excellent choice for prototyping APIs quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "#4. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "Routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs to functions (views). When a user visits a specific URL, Flask uses the defined route to determine which function should handle the request. For example, / can be routed to a home page function, while /users can return a list of users. Flask provides the @app.route() decorator to define routes. Routing allows dynamic URLs with parameters (e.g., /user/<id>). This feature makes Flask applications flexible in responding to different types of client requests. Routing is central to building both web pages and APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "#5. How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "\n",
        "To create a simple Flask app:\n",
        "\n",
        "Install Flask using pip install flask.\n",
        "\n",
        "Create a Python file (e.g., app.py).\n",
        "\n",
        "    Import Flask:\n",
        "\n",
        "    from flask import Flask\n",
        "    app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    Define a route:\n",
        "\n",
        "    @app.route(\"/\")\n",
        "    def home():\n",
        "      return \"Hello, Flask!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Run the server:\n",
        "\n",
        "    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
        "       app.run(debug=True)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This minimal setup creates a working web application. Visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000/ will show \"Hello, Flask!\".\n",
        "\n",
        "#6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "HTTP methods define the type of action to perform on a resource:\n",
        "\n",
        "GET > Retrieve data (Read).\n",
        "\n",
        "POST > Create new data (Insert).\n",
        "\n",
        "PUT > Update existing data (Replace).\n",
        "\n",
        "PATCH > Partially update data.\n",
        "\n",
        "DELETE > Remove data.\n",
        "\n",
        "OPTIONS > Check supported methods for a resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "HEAD > Similar to GET but without the response body.\n",
        "These methods make REST APIs predictable and easy to use by following CRUD principles.\n",
        "\n",
        "#7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "The @app.route() decorator is used to bind a URL path to a specific function in Flask. For example, @app.route(\"/users\") means whenever /users is requested, the associated function is executed. It helps in defining multiple endpoints in a structured way. It also supports dynamic paths, like /user/<id>. This makes it possible to build RESTful API endpoints easily. Without @app.route(), Flask would not know how to handle requests for different URLs.\n",
        "\n",
        "#8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "\n",
        "GET: Used to retrieve data from the server. Parameters are sent in the URL query string (e.g., /users?id=1). It is idempotent (repeated requests give the same result).\n",
        "\n",
        "POST: Used to send data to the server, usually in the request body. Commonly used for creating new records. Unlike GET, POST is not idempotent (repeated requests may create duplicates).\n",
        "In summary, GET = read, POST = create.\n",
        "\n",
        "#9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask provides multiple ways to handle errors:\n",
        "\n",
        "Using abort() function for common errors (abort(404)).\n",
        "\n",
        "Defining custom error handlers with @app.errorhandler().\n",
        "\n",
        "Returning JSON error responses for APIs.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    @app.errorhandler(404)\n",
        "    def not_found(error):\n",
        "      return {\"error\": \"Resource not found\"}, 404\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This ensures users get meaningful responses instead of generic HTML errors. Proper error handling improves API usability.\n",
        "\n",
        "#10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "\n",
        "You can connect Flask to a database using libraries like Flask-SQLAlchemy or raw SQL with SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL connectors. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n",
        "    app.config[\"SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI\"] = \"sqlite:///test.db\"\n",
        "    db = SQLAlchemy(app)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This setup initializes a database. Then, you can define models (tables) and interact with the database using ORM methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "#11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask-SQLAlchemy is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) extension. It allows you to interact with a database using Python classes instead of raw SQL queries. You define models as Python classes, and Flask-SQLAlchemy handles table creation, queries, and relationships. Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    class User(db.Model):\n",
        "      id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
        "      name = db.Column(db.String(50))\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "With this, you can run User.query.all() instead of writing SELECT * FROM users;. It simplifies database operations and makes code more readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "#12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "Blueprints allow developers to organize large Flask applications into smaller modules. Instead of writing all routes in one file, you can create separate files (blueprints) for different features (e.g., auth.py, users.py). Each blueprint can define its routes and then be registered with the main app. Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    from flask import Blueprint\n",
        "    auth_bp = Blueprint(\"auth\", __name__)\n",
        "    @auth_bp.route(\"/login\")\n",
        "    def login():\n",
        "       return \"Login Page\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This improves code organization, scalability, and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "#13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "\n",
        "The request object provides access to HTTP request data sent by the client. It includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "request.args → Query parameters (GET data).\n",
        "\n",
        "request.form → Form data (POST data).\n",
        "\n",
        "request.json → JSON payload.\n",
        "\n",
        "request.headers → Request headers.\n",
        "\n",
        "request.method → HTTP method used.\n",
        "This object is essential for handling client input in APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "#14. How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "To create a RESTful API endpoint:\n",
        "\n",
        "from flask import Flask, jsonify, request\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "    @app.route(\"/api/users\", methods=[\"GET\"])\n",
        "    def get_users():\n",
        "      users = [{\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Alice\"}]\n",
        "      return jsonify(users)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Here /api/users is the endpoint. Using methods=[\"GET\"] defines the request type. jsonify() ensures the response is in JSON format.\n",
        "\n",
        "#15. What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n",
        "\n",
        "The jsonify() function is used to convert Python dictionaries/lists into JSON responses. It automatically sets the Content-Type header to application/json, ensuring proper API responses. Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    return jsonify({\"message\": \"Success\"})\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This is preferred over return json.dumps(...) because jsonify integrates with Flask’s response system.\n",
        "\n",
        "#16. Explain Flask’s url_for() function\n",
        "\n",
        "The url_for() function dynamically generates URLs for routes. Instead of hardcoding paths, you reference the function name. Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    @app.route(\"/profile/<username>\")\n",
        "    def profile(username):\n",
        "      return f\"Profile: {username}\"\n",
        "\n",
        "url_for(\"profile\", username=\"Alice\")\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This would return /profile/Alice. It ensures routes remain consistent even if endpoints change later.\n",
        "\n",
        "#17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask automatically serves static files from the /static folder. By default, you place CSS, JS, and images inside project/static/. You can then reference them in templates using url_for(\"static\", filename=\"style.css\"). Flask handles mapping and ensures efficient delivery of these files.\n",
        "\n",
        "#18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        "An API specification acts as a blueprint for designing an API. It lists available endpoints, request methods, parameters, expected responses, and error codes. When building Flask APIs, a specification ensures developers know what to implement and clients know how to use it. It also allows tools like Swagger UI to auto-generate documentation. This makes APIs more reliable, consistent, and easier to test.\n",
        "\n",
        "#19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        "HTTP status codes indicate the result of an HTTP request:\n",
        "\n",
        "200 OK > Success.\n",
        "\n",
        "201 Created > New resource created.\n",
        "\n",
        "400 Bad Request > Invalid client input.\n",
        "\n",
        "401 Unauthorized > Authentication required.\n",
        "\n",
        "404 Not Found > Resource missing.\n",
        "\n",
        "500 Internal Server Error > Server failure.\n",
        "They provide meaningful feedback to API consumers, helping in debugging and proper client-side handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "#20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "You handle POST requests by specifying methods=[\"POST\"] in @app.route(). Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    @app.route(\"/api/add\", methods=[\"POST\"])\n",
        "    def add_user():\n",
        "       data = request.json\n",
        "       return jsonify({\"message\": \"User added\", \"data\": data}), 201\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, request.json reads JSON body data. Returning status code 201 indicates successful creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "#21. How would you secure a Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask APIs can be secured using:\n",
        "\n",
        "Authentication (API keys, JWT tokens, OAuth).\n",
        "\n",
        "Authorization (role-based access control).\n",
        "\n",
        "Input validation & sanitization (to prevent SQL injection, XSS).\n",
        "\n",
        "HTTPS for encrypted communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rate limiting (to prevent abuse).\n",
        "\n",
        "CORS policies (restrict cross-domain access).\n",
        "Flask extensions like Flask-JWT-Extended and Flask-Limiter make implementing security easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "#22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask-RESTful is an extension that simplifies building REST APIs. It provides a Resource class where you can define HTTP methods (get, post, put, delete) as class methods. Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    from flask_restful import Resource, Api\n",
        "    api = Api(app)\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The session object in Flask is used to store data across requests for a specific user. Unlike request, which lasts only during one request, session data persists until the user logs out or the session expires. Flask stores sessions securely using signed cookies. Example:\n",
